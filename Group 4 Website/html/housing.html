      Get the lifestyle you want with our fully furnished apartments featuring
      private bedroom and bathroom floor plans, 24 hour, state-of-the-art fitness center and Academic Success Center!
      Plus, our professional on-site management and staff dedicated to serving your needs and helping you enjoy your
      college experience at UWT. When you live on campus, you can be independent, but not alone. With all kinds of activities
      and events happening every day, there are always new friends to make, new experiences to try and new interests to

      life programming, a vibrant community of learners, and a safe environment that facilitates academic success. At the
      University of Washington, tuition should not be a factor in which students do not pursue their lifetime goals. Through
      grants, scholarships, and financial aid the University of Washington has 42% of undergraduate students receiving the
      Husky Promise. In which, The University of Washington is promising students a future.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Husky Promise is our
      guarantee to Washington state students that we will not let financial challenges stand in the way of discovering
      their potential or achieving a UW degree (University of Washington, 2018). For UWT undergraduates, sharing a two-bedroom
      apartment with three other students costs $732 a month, or $2,196 a quarter. Sharing a one-bedroom with another student
      costs $959 per month, or $2,877 per quarter, while two students sharing a studio each pay $846 per month or
      $2,538 quarterly. Those rates are slightly more expensive than what students pay to live in double-rooms at the older
      residence halls on the north side of UW Seattle, but cheaper than the rates for UW Seattle’s newer dorms on the west
      side of campus. A double room at the newer UW Seattle dorms costs $2,994 per quarter, and the facilities don’t include a
      private kitchen.
