      <h2>Getting Your Education at UW Tacoma</h2>
      <div id="aboutEducation">
        Your first year, and throughout your time at UW Tacoma, you will be in small classes taught 100 percent by faculty who feel
        inspired to seek innovative approaches to teaching, have a passion for research and are engaged with the region --
        there are no auditorium-style or TA-taught classes. Faculty here believe in a small learning environment, where professors
        and students all get to know each other in a collaborative, creative learning process.

      <h2>Prospective Freshmen</h2>
      <div id="prospects">
        <h3>You are considered a prospective freshman if any of the following statements describe you:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You are in high school and plan to enter UW Tacoma immediately after graduating.</li>
          <li>You are in the Running Start program and plan to enter UW Tacoma right after graduating, regardless of how many
            college credits you have earned or will earn.</li>
          <li>You have never attended college since leaving high school, regardless of your age or whether you ever graduated.</li>

        <h2>Prospective Transfer Students</h2>
        <p id="transfer">
          A transfer applicant has attended a college or university after high school graduation (summer excluded) but has not yet
          earned a bachelor's degree. (Students who have already earned a bachelor's degree should apply as a post-baccalaureate
          student.) Transfer applicants may apply directly to a major program, or may apply as undeclared or pre-major, depending
          on the number of credits earned at the time of application and eligibility. UW Tacoma Admissions staff are experts
          at helping you plan your transfer and transition to UW Tacoma successfully. Don't hesitate to contact UW Tacoma
          at 253-692-4742 or 800-736-7750 if you have any questions or to schedule a campus visit.

        <h2>Prospective International Students</h2>
        <p id="international">
          You are considered an international student if you are not a U. S. citizen or permanent resident and you plan to attend a
          college, university, or other post-secondary education institution in the U.S. This includes applicants that hold
          U.S. visas as students, exchange visitors, or other non-immigrant classifications.

            Your application does not have to be completed in one session; you can log in and work on your application whenever
            you want. You do not pay the application fee until you have completed your application. A credit or debit card
