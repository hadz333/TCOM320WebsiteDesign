    <h2>Where to Eat </h2>
    <p>
      Forget traditional college cafeterias. At UW, students can choose from four types of contemporary dining.
      The university’s three food courts, which serve a variety of international cuisines and classic dishes, are
      especially popular. Chief among them is the Husky Den, which includes a fully-stocked salad bar, classic burger
      joint, and hot breakfast station.
    </p>
    <p>
      On-campus cafés and markets give Huskies a chance to recharge with a quick coffee
      or pick up fresh groceries and chef-prepared side dishes for home cooking. And last but not least, UW Street Food
      is a collection of food trucks that serve made-to-order breakfast sandwiches, hot dogs, barbeque, and “island-style”
      dishes all day long. Everyone has to eat, and active, growing college students are definitely no exception! Realizing
      that campus food will form the majority of their diet for the next four years, it’s worth considering what that will
      look like – from the variety of options available, to nutrition content, to accommodating dietary restrictions
      (due to allergies, religious customs, moral/ethical concerns, etc.).
