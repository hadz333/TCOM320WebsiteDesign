          hundreds of students who commute to and from campus. The furthest south campus of the University of Washington, UWT
          has become the prime location for those students who live further south. There is much activities students can There
          are many fun and family-friendly events & activities within Tacoma. Feel like exploring, looking for party venues, or
          just need to get out and about? Student organizations can sponsor commercial activities, commercial vendors, or events
          that promote commercial entities, only if it can be demonstrated that the student organization and/or UW Tacoma students
          in general are receiving the primary benefit from such activity. If the commercial activity involves sales or
          fundraising. Commercial activities and fundraising and/or sales on University premises are regulated to comply with the

            There are many events and activities hosted at UW
          Tacoma and off-campus that are student initiated and implemented! Every week will vary with different events and
          activities. There are lectures, celebrations, educational programming, social events and activities, community based
          programming, readings, performances, competitions, and many more! For the first two weeks of each quarter, Welcome Days
          programming is hosted by the Department of Student Engagement and other UW Tacoma affiliated offices to get students
          connected to programs and services across campus. You will have the opportunity to check out these programs and
          services during the Involvement Fair (held in Gillenwater Plaza during the first week) and other activities
          throughout the two weeks. Don't worry if you miss out on Welcome Days, you can always check out other events and
          activities happening throughout the school year! Most student programming around campus throughout the year is hosted
          by the Student Activities Board (SAB). The Family Programs Coordinator hosts family-friendly events such as
          Make-it-and-Take it, discounted tickets to Zoolights and film-screenings, and ice skating!
